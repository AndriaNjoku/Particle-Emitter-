# Particle Emitter

This is a particle emitter application built with Kotlin and Android Jetpack Compose. The application generates a system of particles with various properties such as color, trajectory, speed, and diameter. The particles are generated in a fan-like pattern, with variations including a right-left fan and a right fan.

The particles are created within a Composable function, `ParicleSystem`, which takes in the number of particles and the variation of the particle system as parameters. Each particle is given a random color, trajectory, speed, and diameter. The trajectory and speed of the particles are animated using Jetpack Compose's animation APIs, creating a dynamic and visually appealing particle system.

The application also includes a preview function, `PreviewParticleSystem`, for previewing the particle system within the Android Studio IDE.
